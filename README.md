# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Hi, my name is James Travis Mundy. I recently graduated with a BSc in Software Development from WGU. I'm currently interning at a local creative agency learning their stack and helping whereever I can. 

# ðŸŒ± Currently Learning 

Luckily enough, WGU provides access to LinkedIn learning and Pluralsight. Currently I am going through OOP concepts (again!), learning the more advanced features of C#, and learning more and more about blazor!

As part of my internship, I am working with blazor and right now I am responsible for implementing form and data validation, and creating tests for them. I am utilizing Bogus and FluentValidation to accomplish these tasks. 

# ðŸ“˜ Interests 

Outside of developing and growing my skills as a developer I am an avid karateka.  Infact, taking the lessons with me that I have learned through the martial arts is what got me to where I am currently.
It help shift me from a fear-based mindset to a growth-based mindset and I find I am all the happier for it.

Besides martial arts and coding, I like to read anything and everything. I am slowly making my way through a list of the "great" books. http://www.read52booksin52weeks.com/p/well-educated-mind.html In no particular order and at my own pace. 

I also have been known to game from time to time and recently I have taken to restoring my old gaming hardware, getting that working, revisiting old favorites, and finding ones I have never played!

# ðŸ’» I'm looking to collaborate on..

Looking for some open source projects to contribute to.
